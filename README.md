Howdy :) I'm a curious hacker, and I love learning! I'm [non-binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender), please use [they/them pronouns](https://pronoun.is/they) for me. I spend much of my time writing [Nix](https://nixos.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I'm [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/about) alumni.

I have a lot of favorite tools, including [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [radare2](https://rada.re/n/radare2.html), [lldb](https://lldb.llvm.org/), [entr](https://eradman.com/entrproject/), [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), [bwrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap), [bpftrace](https://bpftrace.org/), [visidata](https://www.visidata.org/), [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), and [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
